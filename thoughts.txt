It works, to my eyes it meets all requirements for exceeds expectation. However... feels clunky...
Especially lines 179 down.
I'm checking validation while also throwing flags up. 
Other than just a long list of 
if(!email.parentNode.classList.includes('valid')){
email.parentNode.classList.add('not-valid');
email.nextElementSibling.style.display = 'inherit';
e.preventDefault();
}
7 times... 
which maybe feels worse?
Struggling to find the balance between don't repeat stuff and also having each function do 1 thing... 
Sleep on it? 
send it to slack? 
for sure not the only issues, the whole thing feels like a caveman brute forcing it...
